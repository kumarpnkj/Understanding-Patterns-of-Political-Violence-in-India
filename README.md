# Patterns of Political Violence in India

This repository contains data analysis and visualization related to the patterns of political violence across different regions in India from 2016 to 2024. The goal of this analysis is to identify areas most affected by political violence and understand the characteristics of incidents to guide policymaking and intervention strategies.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source**: Publicly available data from government reports and news articles covering incidents of political violence, including information on geographic location, type of event, and fatalities.
- **Objective**: To analyze and identify regional patterns of political violence in India and categorize these incidents using clustering methods.
- **Clustering Analysis**: The dataset is analyzed using k-means clustering, which helps in grouping incidents based on their geographic and other key characteristics.

## Analysis Methods

1. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Clustering Analysis**: Using k-means clustering to categorize incidents into three geographic clusters.
3. **Distance Analysis**: Calculating geodesic distances to understand the spread of incidents within each cluster.
4. **Visualization**: Creation of multiple visualizations to represent the findings, including cluster distributions and geodesic distance analysis.

## Notebooks and Scripts

- **Patterns of Political Violence in India.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete analysis, including data processing, clustering, distance calculations, and visualizations.

## Key Findings

- Political violence in India is most prevalent in the eastern and northeastern regions, with these areas accounting for the highest number of incidents and fatalities.
- Southern regions have fewer incidents, but they tend to be more severe, resulting in higher fatalities per event.
- Understanding these regional variations can help policymakers target interventions where they are most needed.

## How to Use the Notebook
